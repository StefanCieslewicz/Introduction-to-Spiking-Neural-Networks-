    "<h3> Introduction </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent advancements in the in artificial intelligence can be largely attributed to neural networks (NNs), a machine learning model that recognizes patterns and makes predictions. Artificial neural networks consist of many layers, each consisting of \"neurons\", this type of a machine learning model is clearly inspired by biological neural networks, yet it remains fundamentally different from them. While research around classic NNs is not losing momentum, another type of neural networks is beginning to gain attention; spiking neural networks (SNNs). They present a different approach to processing data, they aim to emulate brain dynamics and energy efficiency of real neurons. \n",
    "As we progress further in the field of machine learning, we should shift our attention to unconventional computation methods and explore SNNs and neuromorphic computing - an approach to hardware and computation, strive to achieve more efficient and brain like computation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> How do Spiking Neural Networks work </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "SNNs are rather unique from artificial neural network perspective, they have internal temporal states, which means that the timing of input data that passes thru neuron matters. If an input is given to neuron A and it decays before neuron B spikes, then neuron C (that is connected to neuron A and neuron B) will be less likely to spike. Spikes are discrete events they try to emulate biological neuron's action potentials. Because of temporal states, SNNs process information asynchronously, this is a major difference to how ANNs process data. Artificial neural network processes layer by layer, either forward or backward (Backpropagation), in spiked neural networks a neuron at n-th layer may spike at the exact same time that a neuron at i-th layer spikes. Our brain processes data asynchronously which is one of the factors that make it extremely energy efficient. However, because of this difference, SNNs cannot benefit from well known algo back prop and gradient etc\n",
